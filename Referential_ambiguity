Referential ambiguity occurs when it's unclear to whom or what a pronoun refers to in a sentence. Here are more examples of referential ambiguity:

1. **John and Michael were playing basketball. He scored a three-pointer.**
   - It's unclear whether "he" refers to John or Michael.

2. **Lisa gave her book to Sarah, and she was happy.**
   - It's unclear whether "she" refers to Lisa or Sarah.

3. **The teacher asked the students to bring their assignments, but only a few did.**
   - It's unclear whether "did" refers to bringing assignments or completing them.

4. **Tom told Jerry he would meet him at the park.**
   - It's unclear whether "him" refers to Tom or Jerry.

5. **The two friends went to the museum. They enjoyed the exhibits.**
   - It's unclear which of the two friends is referred to by "They."

6. **The cat chased the dog, but it got away.**
   - It's unclear whether "it" refers to the cat or the dog.

In each of these examples, the use of pronouns introduces ambiguity about the specific person or thing being referred to, leading to confusion or multiple interpretations of the sentence. Clarifying the reference or using more explicit language can help eliminate referential ambiguity.
